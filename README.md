The goal of this notebook is to use ordinary least squares regression to provide golfers with a meaningful way to improve their scoring average. I want to make clear that this regression likely won't be great for predicting scoring averages. There are many variables (nearly 1500 in the dataset) that can be used to predict someone's average golf score. Due to this, it's unlikely that any single variable is going to be able to reliably predict an all-encompassing statistic such as scoring average. So all I want to do is see if there's some facet of golf that players can focus on improving. If they target that part of their game, then perhaps thier scoring average will consequently improve . Thus this OLS regression will aim to justify some sort of mild linear relationship between a predictor variable and scoring average.
